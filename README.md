## Offline Voice (Free, Open-Source)

We use free, offline engines for speech:
- STT: Vosk (offline)
- TTS: pyttsx3 (offline)

### Install

```bash
pip install vosk soundfile pyttsx3
```

Download a Vosk model and set `VOSK_MODEL_PATH` to the extracted folder:
- English (small): https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
- Kinyarwanda: use any community model if available; otherwise STT falls back.

Example `.env` entries:

```
VOSK_MODEL_PATH=C:\models\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
